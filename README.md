# Commands

Commands, also known as console commands and slash commands, are advanced features activated by typing certain strings of text. They can be executed in command blocks and datapacks or via chat.
    
This repository contains documentation for various different Minecraft commands and examples of them.   
Here is a list of commands so far:

# Datapacks

The data pack system provides a way for players to further customize their Minecraft experience. Data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, item modifiers, recipes, structures, tags, damage types, world generation settings, and biomes without any code modification.
   
This repository contains some different datapacks I have collected and made.

## Player Head Drops

Drop player heads on death

## Movable Armour Stands

Allow movement of armour stands

# Plugins
A plugin (or a multiplayer plug-in) is an additive file for a Minecraft multiplayer server. Plugins do not change the game itself, as a mod does. Plugins are usually written in java and end in `.jar`.    

All plugins in this repository are written for paper, and may or may not work on other versions.   

## Plugin 1
Hello

# Skript

Skript is a Minecraft plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people to modify their servers without learning Java.      
Custom skripts are located in the scripts folder within the Skript folder, and should end in `.sk`.   
To enable, disable, and reload scripts, use the command `/sk`.     
Within the Skripts folder are a collection of different `.sk` files.   

## Requirements
- Minecraft `1.9+`
- Spigot *or* Paper (fork of Spigot) | **CraftBukkit will not work**
- Skript

Some skript may require:

- Newer Minecraft versions
- SkBee
- skDragon
- SkQuery
- skRayFall
- Other Skript addons

## List
- 1.sk - does this    
- 2.sk - does that

# Mods

Mods (short for modifications) change Minecraft's game content in some way, such as to make minor adjustments to the game's mechanics or implement entirely new features. Mods are `.jar`.    

## Forge

Forge is an Autodesk set of APIs and services used by software developers to build innovative cloud-powered apps.

## Fabric

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods.
